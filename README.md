## TO DO LIST ORGANISER

This is a simple shell application that allows user to store and maintain a TODO LIST. After choosing their input and output files(.csv), users can view, add, delete and tag actions to their TODOLIST through a command line interface.

This application is an assessment during my internship at Tinkerbox.
The requirements of the assessment can be found [HERE](https://gist.github.com/gohdaniel15/192bc903d590faaefa08fff4e92899b6)
